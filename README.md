# ImSafe Frontend App

This app is built using React Native and [Expo](https://expo.io/).

## Get Started

To get started, install the Expo CLI and run `expo start`, which opens up a web interface for viewing the web version on a `localhost` port, or scanning the QR code with your phone's Expo app to view it on-device.
